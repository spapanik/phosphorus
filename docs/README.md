Phosphorus is deprecated, as [uv_build] is a compliant and fast build backend.
Phosphorus was created as a [PEP 621] compliant build backend, in the era that the only other backends were deeply problematic, and was never meant to be a part of the [proliferation of standards][standards].
Therefore, after uv, there is no point in continuing the development of phosphorus.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
